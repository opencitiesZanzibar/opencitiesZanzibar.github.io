Overview

Open Cities Africa, is an initiative carried out in 10 cities in Sub-Saharan Africa, to engage local government, civil society, and the private sector to develop the information infrastructures necessary to meet 21st century urban resilience challenges. The project is aligned with The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recoveryâ€™s (GFDRR) Resilient Cities Program and is implemented through a unique partnership between GFDRR and the World Bank, city governments, and a partner community comprised of regional scientific and technology organizations, development partners, and technology companies to support upcoming or ongoing World Bank supported activities in the selected cities.

Zanzibar City is a densely populated urban area with significant threat of flooding. For the purposes of disaster risk management, the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (RGoZ), specifically the Commission for Lands (COLA) and the Department of Urban Planning, have noted with urgency the need to update their Zanzibar Master Plan with locations of all the built structures and flood prone areas in the city.

Spatial Collective, the implementing partner for the initiative spent months on Zanzibar building capacity of the local stakeholders and coordinating various data collection activities. The goal was to generate and visualize datasets critical to disaster risk management and build local capacity in the process.
